      <h2>1.Sustainable and Affordable alternatives to wood charcoal and
        firewood.</h2>

      <p>Wood charcoal and firewood are a main source of energy for a greater
        percentage of most homes. In fact, the United Nations estimates that
        more than 950 million people rely on wood and charcoal for cooking in
        Sub-Saharan Africa alone; that number will rise to 1.67 billion by
        2050. They are mainly preferred as they are easily available in the
        market and cheaper compared to electricity or gas further to note
        acquiring the technologies to use them is expensive, whereas the later
        the technologies that support their consumption are highly accessible;
        indeed, firewood can be consumed without stoves, because basically
        materials such as stones are sufficient to balance the cooking
        utensils, especially in rural areas. The enduring appeal of charcoal,
        and its positive association with the flavor of food, continues to
        make it a popular choice for cooking in households.</p>

      <p>In this project we aim to bring to light more efficient ways of
        energy such as compost briquettes which are much cheaper, have low
        carbon emissions ,do not require cutting down of trees and can be
        obtained anywhere and everywhere since basically you just have to get
        household waste, fallen tree leaves, agricultural waste.</p>

      <p>More benefits that arise from briquettes are a cleaner environment as
        waste from households goes into better use. Creating safer jobs to the
        men involved in cutting of trees and burning charcoal which is
        sometimes done illegally. Reducing forest fires that occur due to
        burning of charcoal which cause great damage that takes years to
        reverse. Inclusion of community in safer energy sources by collecting
        household and agricultural waste. Cost saving as briquettes are made
        on uniform sizes and therefore makes it easy to count on how many one
        can use per combustion or per cook thus minimizing wastage.</p>

      <h2>2.Climate Policy Council</h2>
      <p>While each country has its set legal frameworks to govern climate
        change, less is known on how they conduct their duties or how they
        make progress on their climate advocacy.</p>
      <p>In this project, we advocate for the creation of a climate policy
        council to hold the government accountable and analyze policy set by
        the government and how it aligns to climate goals set by the
        Parliament and government. The Council will hold the government
        accountable through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bringing attention to societal effects of proposed policy</li>
        <li>Recognizing deficient policy</li>
        <li>Analyzing short- and long-term targets with climate and budget
          policy goals in mind</li>
        <li>Promoting discussion on climate policy in society</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The climate policy council need not be within a country in limitation
        of financial resources. We have countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and
        Chile which are leading in climate policy and they could come in
        agreement with developing countries and hold them accountable in their
        going green.</p>
      <p>Their involvement will help in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assessing the impact of current policies in various sectors on
          climate objectives</li>
        <li>Analyzing the societal repercussions of both established and
          forthcoming policies</li>
        <li>Recognizing the policy domains requiring supplementary actions to
          align with climate targets</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3.Education and awareness</h2>
      <p>Climate change is a global issue that needs to be addressed and acted
        upon for a greener future. We have all heard about it in a slogan, in
        an activist rally, or just a blog, but do we really know what it
        entails? We are all aware that our carbon emissions need to sink to
        zero by 2050 at the latest to stop climate change. To achieve this
        goal, we must radically change our lives.</p>
      <p>Education is crucial to promote climate action. It helps people
        understand and address the impacts of the climate crisis, empowering
        them with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes needed to act
        as agents of change.</p>
      <p>Here are some ways to promote climate change education and awareness:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>**Get society on the same page.** Tell communities how they would
          benefit if they could plant more trees, use greener energy, and
          minimize printing. Sensitize people on waste management by having
          different color litter bins, e.g., green for recyclable waste, red
          for plastics, and yellow for metals and glass.</li>

        <li>**Take climate change education to schools.** Teach kids how they
          make an impact on the environment. Implement board games and other
          activities that teach about climate change. Make climate change
          education part of the curriculum, and give incentives to students
          who make the most change in their environment.</li>

        <li>**Advocate for companies to be on the green movement.** Encourage
          companies to minimize printing, use recycled materials, and reduce
          their carbon footprint.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>By educating and raising awareness about climate change, we can
        create a more sustainable future for all.</p>
