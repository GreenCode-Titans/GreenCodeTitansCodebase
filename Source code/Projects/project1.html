        <h2>Sustainable and Affordable alternatives to wood charcoal and
          firewood.</h2>

        <p>Wood charcoal and firewood are a main source of energy for a greater
          percentage of most homes. In fact, the United Nations estimates that
          more than 950 million people rely on wood and charcoal for cooking in
          Sub-Saharan Africa alone; that number will rise to 1.67 billion by
          2050. They are mainly preferred as they are easily available in the
          market and cheaper compared to electricity or gas further to note
          acquiring the technologies to use them is expensive, whereas the later
          the technologies that support their consumption are highly accessible;
          indeed, firewood can be consumed without stoves, because basically
          materials such as stones are sufficient to balance the cooking
          utensils, especially in rural areas. The enduring appeal of charcoal,
          and its positive association with the flavor of food, continues to
          make it a popular choice for cooking in households.</p>

        <p>In this project we aim to bring to light more efficient ways of
          energy such as compost briquettes which are much cheaper, have low
          carbon emissions ,do not require cutting down of trees and can be
          obtained anywhere and everywhere since basically you just have to get
          household waste, fallen tree leaves, agricultural waste.</p>

        <p>More benefits that arise from briquettes are a cleaner environment as
          waste from households goes into better use. Creating safer jobs to the
          men involved in cutting of trees and burning charcoal which is
          sometimes done illegally. Reducing forest fires that occur due to
          burning of charcoal which cause great damage that takes years to
          reverse. Inclusion of community in safer energy sources by collecting
          household and agricultural waste. Cost saving as briquettes are made
          on uniform sizes and therefore makes it easy to count on how many one
          can use per combustion or per cook thus minimizing wastage.</p>
