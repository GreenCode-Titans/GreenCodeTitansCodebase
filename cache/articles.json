Locally, we have experienced floods, change in rainfall patterns, droughts, heat waves and increase in temperatures.Have Kenyan curricula addressed how we can curb climate change? The Kenya Climate Change Act of 2016 gives precedence to development, management, implementation and regulation of mechanisms to enhance climate change resilience and low carbon development for sustainable development.The 2010 National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) was supposed to address climate change issues such as Communication, education and awareness.As of May 2020, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, recognised that a formidable emissions gap remains between the aspirational goals of the Paris Agreement and the real-world pledges and actions is still a challenge.Both ministries also appreciate that closing the emissions gap can be achieved if the education gap between scientific and societal understanding of climate change is also closed.Strong political commitmentThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) advocates that there is need for improving awareness and understanding of climate change.That there\u2019s need for creating solutions to facilitate access to information on a changing climate to win public support for climate-related policies.UNFCCC through its Article 6, has been rallying all governments to educate, empower and engage all stakeholders and major groups on policies relating to climate change. This call, according to the convention, has been echoed by Article 10e of the Kyoto Protocol as well as the Article 12 of the Paris Agreement.Climate change effectsKenya submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution to UNFCCC in December 2020. As part of the mitigation process, the proposal shows that Kenya\u2019s approach to curbing climate change will be an all-society action plan.The proposal leaves a lot to be desired on the role and contribution of education enhancing adaptive capacity in fighting climate change locally.While appreciating this fact, we must be cognisant of the fact that climate change is also affecting our education system. Enrolment of pupils is low in areas that are faced with harsh climate change effects.It\u2019s believed that failure to adequately meet basic needs, such as clean water, food, and shelter, among others, is also leading to low enrolment and poor school attendance.Conflicts for pastures and water sources among nomadic communities stop learners from going to school. Education has been championed as suitable for enhancing climate change knowledge among the youth.At a young age, children have the ability to grasp, internalise the effects of global warming and further contribute to measures of adapting and mitigating climate change. Curriculum developers ought to design syllabi that encompass understanding of the climate systems.We hope stakeholders spearheading climate change initiatives will continue to encourage, invest more and enhance real-time approaches to integrate realistic climate change education for sustainable development, approaches that will be interdisciplinary, cross-cutting and whole-school. In addition, there must a stronger political commitment and goodwill across all stakeholders to mainstream climate change into Kenya\u2019s curricula.The importance of education for sustainable development cannot be gainsaid. Kenya\u2019s free primary and subsidised secondary education is a progressive system. Like other studies that have been progressively integrated into the education system, integrating climate change content into curricula is now more than ever, inevitable.There\u2019s need for all relevant stakeholders to develop frameworks and policies that will equip the young people with an understanding and consequences of global warming for them to adapt accordingly.", "source": "nation-africa", "url": "https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/blogs/fight-climate-change-good-education--3249400", "classified_as": "TRUE"}, {"title": "Stakeholders decry gender inequality in climate change policiesCivil Societies Organizations in Isiolo and Marsabit have decried gender inequality, limited resources and patriarchy in the climate change adaptation.

That means planting 4,109,590 trees per day.Environment and climate change experts have longed for such a bold and deliberate move, especially driven from the top echelons of government. Kenyans should support the undertaking; climate change is real and here with us for long.Climate change is a long-term shift or change in climate and weather patterns. These initially naturally occurred but, since the 1800s, have been primarily caused by human activity, such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.These and other climate change triggers like the burning of bushes and forests, common transportation means, industrial works and any human activity that depends on oil as fuel, gas and natural resource exploitation leads to the production of gases like carbon dioxide, methane and others\u2014called greenhouse gases. These produce a blanket-like condition around Earth, making an energy trap between it and the atmosphere.Drought, irregular climate and weather, delayed and low rainfall and famine are a manifestation of the climate change phenomenon that requires us all to contain, mitigate and adapt to. The earth\u2019s climate has been changing.But in the past 800,000 years, there have been over eight cycles of climate change characterised by ice ages and periods of warmer climate. The last Ice Age 11,700 years ago paved the way for the modern climatic era and increased human civilisations.Trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing the excessive carbon produced through uncontrolled human activity, and purifying the environment by reducing global warming and climate change.Clean and sustainable development, such as the utilisation of clean energy\u2014including geothermal, solar and wind power\u2014and planning of settlements, protection of water towers and riverine ecosystems and climate-smart and adaptive agriculture can help us to tackle climate change.Mr Giti, PhD, is an urban planner.

It comes with many issues and cuts across the society. The question is whether the society really understands climate change\u2014and how to mitigate and adapt to it.Education is key component of addressing climate change. To be meaningful and action-oriented, we must be intentional and committed to invest in and redirect resources to climate literacy. With teachers, youth and children as catalysts of actions towards a healthy planet, we need to give communities knowledge and skills, enhance values and shape attitudes.Among the five key pillars of Kenya\u2019s Second Medium-Term Plan is around climate business to maintain macroeconomic stability, as mentioned in the Budget Statement for Financial Year 2022-2023. The statement says the government is also focusing on \u201cbuilding resilience against climate change\u201d.Support local communitiesThus, the government has allocated Sh6.1 billion to implement the \u201cFinancing Locally-Led Climate Action Program (FLLoCA)\u201d, a 10-year undertaking aimed at mobilising climate finances to support local communities build their resilience and adapt to the impacts of climate change in all the 47 counties.The government says it has finalised the Long-Term Low Emission Strategy to guide a low-carbon climate-resilient development path and will develop a Climate Finance Mobilization Strategy. National Climate Finance Policy 2018 recommends that research institutions and universities play a key role in research, education and capacity building.But there is not much to show how all these financing strategies, mechanisms and options will cover one of the most fundamental aspects of mitigating and adapting to climate change: Education. Bilateral and development partners and the private sector ought to draw more attention to this matter.The more climate change education financing is side-lined, the more it will be unrealistic to meaningfully engage teachers, youth and children. At the resumed UNEA 5.2, Youth Environmental Assembly (YEA) through Children and Youth Major Group and Children reiterated the importance of environmental education. Such sentiments also emerged at Stockholm +50 Youth Policy Consultations.We applaud the government for the National Climate Change Learning Strategy 2021-2031 that shows its implementation will need more than Sh1.3 billion over 10 years. Whether through the National Climate Change Fund, semi-autonomous government agencies, FLLoCA, County Climate Change Funds (CCCFs) or development partners, there still is a huge gap in climate education funding.Perhaps the best chance is in the Fourth Medium-Term Plan (MTP 4) 2023-2027, National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP III) 2023-2027 and Nationally Determined Contribution review in 2025.Adequate climate change education financing will help Kenya to achieve its ambitious climate agenda.", "source": "nation-africa", "url": "https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/blogs/climate-literacy-financing-vital-to-greening-agenda-3848646", "classified_as": "TRUE"}, {"title": "Next", "content": "Kenya's Sh6.2 trillion plan in climate changeKenya to mobilise 13 per cent of this figure from domestic sources, while the rest will come from development partners.", "source": "nation-africa", "url": "https://nation.africa/service/search/kenya/290754?pageNum=1&query=climate%20change", "classified_as": "TRUE"}, {"title": "(-)Climate Change", "content": "Air purifiers have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution in the workplace.

This training had a major positive effect on the lives of its participants, as exemplified by the story of Asia Namusoke. Asia found her training inspiring, prompting her to create small, but smart innovations that are transforming the lives of the women and youth in her low-income community on the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda.The Ugandan village of Ndejje, north of Kampala, is poor, has many people living with HIV/AIDS, and lacks the resources for climate-smart agriculture to sustain livelihoods and protect the environment.Asia Mbajja Namusoke aims to change that.With support from CIWA, the Nile Basin Discourse trained Namusoke and other women as Climate Change Resilience Champions two years ago. She has put her knowledge to good use ever since, developing programs to inspire and provide a lifeline to others in Ndejje and beyond.Uganda Nile Discourse Forum Members (Farmers) at one of the community dialogues on Climate Smart Agriculture. Photo Credit: Nile Basin DiscourseFor example, the training taught her the importance of planting trees, flowers, spices, and vegetables that are climate resilient.\u201cLight came into darkness\u201d during the training, Namusoke says.\u201cI realized that there were small actions one could do to make a difference.\u201d\u201cThe training to work with communities to promote sustainable agriculture was really inspiring,\u201d says Namusoke, who also is founder of the People in Need Agency (PINA), a non-profit organization that helps HIV- positive women and youth play a key role in improving their lives and communities.Her projects are especially empowering to women in her community, many of whom have faced gender-based violence (GBV) and are HIV-positive. To address challenges faced by women and others, Namusoke explains, \u201cI set up a demonstration income- generating and environment-friendly project comprising urban vegetables, rabbit-rearing, beekeeping, a waste recycling center, and a black soldier fly rearing operation for alternative animal protein and high-value crop fertilizer.\u201dThe larvae of black soldier fly insects can convert organic waste into high-quality nutrients for pet food, fish, and poultry feed and even soil fertilizer. Twenty-eight families have now created their own vegetable gardens, 14 families are rearing rabbits, 11 are growing maggots, and 10 have set up beehive apiaries in their yards. The beauty of Namusoke\u2019s projects is that they have a range of benefits from food security to climate change mitigation and better health outcomes.A woman who makes honey from her beehives, for example, can sell the product in the local market and generate income.\u201cThis person can then keep her clinic appointment to obtain life-saving medicine because now she can afford transportation to the clinic,\u201d Namusoke says.\u201cWe work under the principle that the Sustainable Development Goals are integrated\u2014they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability.\u201dFor example, she says, \u201cif you have food in the compound that was grown using sustainable principles, you can achieve the climate aspect of it and the food security aspect of it, too.\"Asia Mbajja Namusoke planting climate-resilient vegetables in Uganda, Kampala.\"The innovation is designed to strike a balance between therapeutic and profitable goals, which are the two key pillars of our income-generating project, \u201d she says. \u201cCommunity members are engaged as waste collectors, project staff, [and] in marketing and sales, and are assisted to start project-related businesses in their homes and communities.\u201d\u201cThis allows them to occupy their time, earn a living, learn skills, and also help with climate and environmental protection efforts, \u201d she says. Her community, like many throughout Africa, is ill-equipped to cope with climate shocks. \u201cWhen it rains, sometimes it floods, and then droughtmay occur, \u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity or resources to irrigate the fields, \u201d which leaves residents vulnerable to variable and unpredictable rainfall.At the CIWA-supported training, Namusoke learned that each community is required to have a water management committee. She met with village leaders and convinced them to form such a committee, and it is now educating residents to stop throwing garbage into drainage systems and to remove dirty bottles and other waste from water points to prevent contamination. The committee has also placed garbage collection bins throughout the community and is encouraging people to recycle.Namusoke hopes one day to establish regional climate change training centers.\u201cThere is so much to learn,\u201d Namusoke says. \u201cThen you can really transform your community. \u201d She adds, \u201cClimate change resilience begins at home.\u201dRelated Links:Nile Basin Development Forum (NBDF)A transformation approach for the Nile Basin: How CIWA leaves its markCIWA launches male champion forum to transform gender inequalities in transboundary waters", "source": "world-bank", "url": "https://blogs.worldbank.org/water/asia-namusoke-making-difference-her-ugandan-community-and-climate", "classified_as": "TRUE"}, {"title": "Of dragons, data and clouds: Bhutan\u2019s journey into carbon markets, technology, and a resilient future", "content": "Nestled within the Eastern Himalayas, Bhutan is often referred to as the \u2018Land of the Thunder Dragon\u2019.

How we manage water resources affects whether poor girls are educated, whether cities are healthy places to live, and whether growing industries or rural villages can withstand the impacts of floods or droughts.Continuing population growth, urbanization, climate change, and economic development are all converging to create a widening gap between water supply and demand which may reduce economic growth by up to 6% in many parts of the world. Addressing a challenge of this scale requires new approaches that tap into every water resource available.Unconventional sources of water, through desalination and reuse and primarily fueled by renewable energy, provide a potential weatherproof solution to address the gap between water demand and supply.As the world\u2019s largest multilateral source of financing for water in developing countries, with an investment portfolio of almost $30 billion, the World Bank is uniquely positioned to support desalination and reuse opportunities. Our work goes beyond financing, with member countries using our technical advice and analysis to design better policies and strengthen their institutions.The World Bank uses a range of financial and technical instruments at its disposal to support desalination and reuse projects globally.In Kiribati, where the population of just over 100,000 is spread over 21 islands across three million square kilometers of ocean, access to safe and reliable water and sanitation remains a challenge. The World Bank is supporting access to safe and reliable water in the capital South Tarawa through the construction of a solar-powered seawater desalination system that is resilient to climate change and meets the increased demand for water. In T\u00fcrkiye, the World Bank is supporting a recently approved circular economy and wastewater reuse project that will improve wastewater and reuse services; increase irrigation services and efficiency; and strengthen institutional capacity and coordination for managing water circularity, thereby increasing the portfolio of water supply options and resilience to climate change.While installed desalination capacity continues to rapidly expand around the world, the governance structures designed for conventional water sources are struggling to catch up. In response to this need, the World Bank has established a Desalination Community of Practice, which aims to generate, capture, and disseminate knowledge on desalination governance and economics, partnering with countries and organizations that are leading in this area and with platforms like the International Desalination Association.Reclaiming and reusing water is central to a water-secure future\u2014one that uses circular economy principles rather than the unsustainable, linear model of \u201ctake, make, consume, and waste.\u201d The World Bank\u2019s Water Global Practice has developed a framework to promote a common understanding of circular economy principles and resilience in the urban water sector and to support countries in implementing these principles. A circular and resilient water system fosters a more sustainable and responsible use of water resources, energy, and other resources, preserves and regenerates water and natural ecosystems, reduces waste and pollution and delivers resilient and inclusive water services, ultimately improving the livelihoods of people while valuing water resources and the environment.As we work to deepen understanding, we also need the investment to put our knowledge and innovative ideas into practice. Investment needs in water-related infrastructure are estimated to reach $6.7 trillion by 2030 and $22.6 trillion by 2050. In line with this significant need, the World Bank, including our private sector arm the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), has recently developed a strategic plan to mobilize public, concessional, and private financing, and to foster an enabling environment for greater private sector investment, innovation, and expertise.If we are to address the water crisis at scale, we need to use unconventional methods and new and disruptive forms of financing for a more sustainable and water-secure future for all.Related Links:Scaling ReWaterWICER FrameworkScaling Up Finance for Water", "source": "world-bank", "url": "https://blogs.worldbank.org/water/tapping-unconventional-water-solutions-climate-crisis", "classified_as": "TRUE"}, {"title": "William Ruto Travels to Congo Brazzaville for Three Basins Climate Change Confer...", "content": "TUKO.co.ke attended a press briefing ahead of the Summit of the Three Basins convened by research group Earth Insight and global partnersThe event closed with a call to action from indigenous, community, and civil society leaders to put human rights at the center of the Three Basins InitiativeAccording to William Ruto, to be effective, this strategy must fund the preservation of carbon sinks and accelerate the adoption of renewable energyDennis Lubanga, a journalist at TUKO.co.ke, brings more than 10 years of experience in covering politics, news, and feature stories across digital and print media.Congo, Brazzaville - President William Ruto has left the country for the Congo, Brazzaville.President William Ruto attended the Summit of the Three Basins.

Photo: William Ruto.Source: FacebookThe Paris Agreement states that keeping global average temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius is critical to avoiding future climate crises.Unfortunately, we are approaching the limit, and exceeding it will have global consequences.Already, East Africa is experiencing its worst drought in decades, and many parts of the world are experiencing adverse weather events because of global warming.As a result, it is prudent to take the necessary steps to mitigate global warming before the effects become irreversible.As simple as they appear, trees play an extremely fundamental role in mitigating global warming.Beyond their aesthetic and ecological values as habitats for diverse species, they serve as nature's lungs, purifying the air by absorbing carbon dioxide. Additionally, trees protect against soil erosion and support ecosystems.In light of these multifaceted benefits, Kenya's noble target of increasing tree cover by an additional 5.1 million hectares by 2032, equivalent to 15 billion trees, is an ecological ambition and a compelling necessity for our planet's well-being and future generations.To achieve this ambitious reforestation goal, it is imperative that we rally collective efforts from all sectors of society.This is not a challenge that the government cannot meet; it requires active engagement and partnership from the private sector.With their substantial resources, influential reach, and innovative potential, businesses are well-positioned to play a pivotal role in this endeavour.They can mobilise their employees and allocate resources to impact tree-planting initiatives significantly.Kibo Africa, for example, has committed to planting 100,000 trees by 2025 to help with restoring forest cover.But above just planting the trees, we aim to take care of them and ensure they reach maturity.This dedication to long-term sustainability shows recognition of the importance of mature trees in carbon sequestration and ecological stability.The daunting scale of the climate crisis demands nothing short of immediate action.The private sector possesses the financial muscle and innovation prowess to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.Regardless of their size or industry, businesses can find ways to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to carbon sequestration through tree planting.Through innovative thinking, they can identify methods to reduce their environmental impact.At Kibo, we recognised the opportunity to address multiple objectives simultaneously and have embarked on the journey of sourcing production materials for our motorcycles locally.This strategic move not only bolsters our contribution to the Kenyan economy through the \"Buy Kenya, Build Kenya\" approach but also significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with our product lifecycles by minimising emissions within our supply chain.Furthermore, to prove that sustainability can be good business, we are reducing lead times for our customers when they want parts for their bikes, making repairs faster.Whether driven by altruistic purposes or self-interest, businesses stand to benefit from investing time and effort into mitigating global warming and climate change.The risks being created by climate change, including supply chain disruptions, increased insurance costs and damage to physical assets in adverse weather conditions, can very easily erode a business's stability and profitability.By proactively pursuing mitigation actions, businesses can protect themselves from these risks. Importantly, as consumers increasingly prioritise sustainability, companies that embrace eco-friendly practices are more likely to thrive in a competitive marketplace.In summation, Kenya is at a critical juncture in its history. The decisions made by everyone today are likely to have a transformative and lasting effect on the country.The private sector's participation in the fight against global warming is not just a moral imperative; it is an economic and environmental necessity.As Africa battles the worst effects of climate change, it is vital for businesses to think of sustainability as more than a box to check in their environmental, social and governance reporting.It must become a part of everyday business operations and go beyond trying to repair some of the damages that have been done.The time is now, and we must all rise to the challenge.The writer is Huib van de Grijspaarde, the CEO of Kibo Africa, and a regular commentator on social, economic and climate affairs.The views expressed here are the writer's and do not in any way represent the position of TUKO.co.keSource: TUKO.co.ke", "source": "tuko-news", "url": "https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/525107-private-sectors-role-combating-global-warming-consideration-placement/", "classified_as": "TRUE"}]
